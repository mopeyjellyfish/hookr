# Commit Convention

This project follows [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/), which is used to automate version management and package publishing.

## Commit Message Format

Each commit message consists of a **header**, a **body** and a **footer**. The header has a special format that includes a **type**, a **scope** and a **subject**:

```git
<type>(<scope>): <subject>
<BLANK LINE>
<body>
<BLANK LINE>
<footer>
```

The **header** is mandatory and the **scope** of the header is optional.

## Type

Must be one of the following:

* **feat**: A new feature
* **fix**: A bug fix
* **docs**: Documentation only changes
* **style**: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, etc)
* **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
* **perf**: A code change that improves performance
* **test**: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
* **build**: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies
* **ci**: Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts
* **chore**: Other changes that don't modify src or test files
* **revert**: Reverts a previous commit

## Subject

The subject contains a succinct description of the change:

* use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes"
* don't capitalize the first letter
* no dot (.) at the end

## Body

The body should include the motivation for the change and contrast this with previous behavior.

## Footer

The footer should contain any information about **Breaking Changes** and is also the place to reference GitHub issues that this commit **Closes**.

**Breaking Changes** should start with the word `BREAKING CHANGE:` with a space or two newlines. The rest of the commit message is then used for this.

## Examples

```
feat(api): add ability to parse arrays
```

```
fix(parser): handle nested objects correctly

This fixes an issue where nested objects would not be parsed correctly.
The parser now properly handles nested objects by recursively parsing them.

Closes #123
```

```
feat(api)!: remove deprecated endpoints

BREAKING CHANGE: The /v1/* endpoints have been removed. Please use /v2/* instead.
```
